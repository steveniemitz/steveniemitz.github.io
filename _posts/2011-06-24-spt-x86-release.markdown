<p><a href="http://www.steveniemitz.com/Blog/post/SPT-A-WinDBG-extension-for-debugging-NET-applications.aspx">Read more about SPT here</a></p>  <p>I've compiled the latest build of SPT for x86.&#160; All functionality should be working fine, but since I don't do much x86 debugging it hasn't been as thoroughly tested as the x64 build.&#160; Let me know if you run into any issues.</p>  <p>This is actually a later build than the x86 version and has some enhanced features, like !findtimers to dump all the active timer objects in the process and enhanced output for some commands.&#160; I'll get the x64 version update posted soon as well.</p>  <h2><a href="http://www.steveniemitz.com/Upload/SPT_11_NET4_x86.zip">Download it here</a></h2>
